# destination: Where they want to travel (Latin America, Europe, Asia, or your custom destinations)
# trip_price: Total cost of the trip in dollars (number)
# lead_source: How they found you (Referral, Website, Repeat, Social Media, or your custom sources)
# current_stage: Current status (inquiry, quote_sent, booked, final_payment, completed, lost, cancelled)
# is_repeat_customer: 1 if returning customer, 0 if new (0 or 1)

# final_payment_date: Date final payment was made (YYYY-MM-DD or blank)

# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# 1. Dates must be in YYYY-MM-DD format
# 2. Leave date fields blank (empty) if that stage hasn't occurred yet
# 3. For lost leads, only inquiry_date and quote_date (if sent) should have values
# 4. For active pipeline, fill in dates up to current stage only
# 5. trip_price should be 0 for lost/cancelled leads
# 6. Current stage values must match exactly: inquiry, quote_sent, booked, final_payment, completed, lost, cancelled
# 7. You need at least 2 years of historical data for accurate forecasting
# 8. Include ALL leads, even ones that didn't convert - this helps train the model
